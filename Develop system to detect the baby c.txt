        Develop system to detect the baby cry detection using various machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble 
classification techniques. This model is trained on crying and non-crying images of babies. The approach involves 
several key techniques in machine learning and computer vision. Firstly, Transfer Learning is employed by using a 
pre-trained model like ResNet50 which has been fine-tuned or directly used for the new task of detecting baby cries. 
Image Preprocessing steps are taken to format the image data to be compatible with the model's input requirements, 
including resizing and normalization. 
        The task at hand is a Binary Classification, where the model outputs a probability score to categorize the input 
into one of two classes: crying or not crying. Finally, Model Inference is performed, which involves using the trained 
model to make predictions on new, unseen data.Overall, this approach can be described as image classification using 
transfer learning with a pre-trained deep learning model. Evaluate our models with several iterations validation and our 
models achieve accuracies of more than 90%.
